%B Background: Gene co-expression network analyses have become a central
approach for the systems-level analysis of biological data. Several software
packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from
correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted
topological overlap (wTO). However, since some genes are able to up- or
down-regulate other genes, it is important to explicitly consider both positive
and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.
Additionally, there has been a growing interest in the systematic comparison of
multiple networks to identify deferentially changed links. Typically, such
analyses are focused on the comparison of networks or data from two different
conditions. Results: Here, we present an R package for calculating the weighted
topological overlap (wTO), that explicitly addresses the sign of wTO values.
The package includes the calculation of p-values (raw and adjusted) for each
pairwise gene score. Our package also allows the calculation of networks from
time series, without replicates. Additionally, our R package incorporates a
novel method for calculating a consensus network (CN) from two or more
networks. To visualize the resulting networks, the R package contains a
visualization tool which allows for the direct network manipulation and access
of node and link information. When testing the package on a standard laptop
computer, we can conduct all calculations for systems of 20,000 genes in under
two hours. Conclusion: In this work, we developed an R package that allows the
computation of wTO networks, CNs and a visualization tool in the R statistical
environment. It is publicly available on CRAN repositories under the GPL-2 Open
Source License (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wTO/).
