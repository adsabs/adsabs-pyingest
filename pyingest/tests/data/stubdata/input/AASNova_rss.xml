<h4>Stellar Spin vs. Planetary Orbit</h4>

[Kerry Hensley]</p></div>Observations of exoplanetary systems have revealed a wide variety of orbital geometries, including planets that orbit in a completely different direction than their host stars are spinning. Researchers have measured the <em>spin–orbit misalignment</em> for dozens of hot Jupiter exoplanets and unearthed a trend: hot Jupiters orbiting small, cool stars are aligned with their stars&#8217; spins, while hot Jupiters orbiting larger, hotter stars can be either aligned or misaligned.</p>
<p>This trend in spin–orbit misalignment hints at how these planetary systems formed and evolved. Previously, researchers suggested that hot Jupiters around small, cool stars tend to be aligned because tidal forces acting on the star&#8217;s atmosphere cause it to reorient its spin to align with the orbit of the planet. Larger, hotter stars are less susceptible to this effect, making misaligned hot Jupiters in these systems more common. This seems to tidily explain what&#8217;s going on for massive planets, but what about smaller planets?</p>

<h4>Into a New Domain</h4>
<p>In a recent research article, a team led by <span data-authors=""><span class="nowrap">Kyle Hixenbaugh</span></span> (Indiana University) measured the spin–orbit misalignment between TOI-1842, a 1.45-solar-mass star, and its planet that is slightly less massive than Saturn. This is the first time this measurement has been made for a sub-Saturn-mass planet around a high-mass star (here, high mass means more than 1.2 solar masses).</p>
<p>To determine TOI-1842&#8217;s spin, the team observed the slight change in the star&#8217;s apparent radial velocity as the planet passed in front of the oncoming and receding sides of the star, known as the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect. Using models to simulate the star&#8217;s light curves and radial velocity measurements, the team found that the planet is considerably misaligned from its star.</p>
<h4>Making Sense of Misalignment</h4>
<p>Based on this measurement, Hixenbaugh and collaborators proposed a new framework to explain the observed trends in spin–orbit misalignment. Instead of tidal dissipation being the driving force, the team proposed that the number of planets in the system plays a defining role. Because the mass of a protoplanetary disk increases with the mass of the star, low-mass stars are likely only able to form a single Jupiter-mass planet, while higher-mass stars have enough material to create multiple Jupiter-mass planets. A single planet around a low-mass star thus forms in a calm environment and is likely to remain aligned to its star, while a planet with multiple Jupiter-mass siblings is knocked off kilter by gravitational interactions.</p>

Aligned systems are plotted as open circles and misaligned systems are plotted as filled triangles. Click to enlarge. [Hixenbaugh et al. 2023]</p></div>While low-mass stars can likely only form a single Jupiter-mass planet, they have enough material to form multiple Saturn-mass or sub-Saturn-mass planets. This means that a sub-Saturn-mass planet around a small, cool star could experience gravitational kicks and nudges from its siblings, knocking it out of alignment, while a Jupiter-mass planet could not. A sub-Saturn-mass planet around a large, hot star is also likely to have multiple planetary siblings and be misaligned. This framework is consistent with observations, though it doesn&#8217;t exclude the possibility that tidal forces play a role as well. Hixenbaugh&#8217;s team notes that more observations are needed to test the new hypothesis.</p>

<p>Astronomers are infamously bad at naming things. So when we observed unexplained quick radio pulses in 2007, we imaginatively dubbed them <a href="https://astrobites.org/2021/03/09/frbs-are-spiraling-out-of-control/">fast radio bursts</a> (FRBs). However, a name does not a physical theory make: the exact cause of these FRBs is still unknown. FRBs are bonkers energetic, putting out as much energy in about a millisecond as the Sun does in three days. The huge energy involved likely implies that FRBs originate from the most extreme objects or events in our universe, such as <a href="https://astrobites.org/2022/02/02/neutron-stars-are-back-on-the-menu-boys/">neutron stars</a>, <a href="https://astrobites.org/2022/11/08/diy-building-massive-black-holes/">black holes</a>, and <a href="https://astrobites.org/2023/01/31/burps-and-explosions-what-happens-when-a-very-very-massive-star-goes-supernova/">supernovae</a>. Also, some FRBs repeat their bursts, but these repetitions are not evenly spaced in time. This rules out cataclysmic one-time events such as <a href="https://astrobites.org/2017/02/16/neutron-star-mergers-may-help-short-grbs-go-boom/">mergers</a> or supernovae, while their uneven spacing is confusing as orbital events have a regular period.</p>

Calçada</a>; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>]</p></div>A breakthrough came when an FRB was observed from SGR 1935+2154, a highly magnetic neutron star called a <a href="https://astrobites.org/2022/11/12/magnetars-makin-waves/">magnetar</a> (Figure 1). While this discovery strongly suggests that at least some FRBs come from magnetars, we are still unclear exactly how magnetars generate these pulses. The authors of today’s article have an interesting hypothetical explanation that will take us deep into the cores of neutron stars: could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition">phase transitions</a> from neutrons to quark matter be causing these mysterious events?</p>
<h4>Neutron Star Anatomy Crash Course</h4>
<p>To understand the cores of neutron stars we first have to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark">quarks</a>. You may have heard of quarks — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton">protons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron">neutrons</a> are each made of three quarks — and we call any particle made up of quarks a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron">hadron</a>. In fact, we have never observed quarks outside a hadron due to a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement">quark confinement</a>. (A proof of quark confinement is one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems#Yang%E2%80%93Mills_existence_and_mass_gap">millennium prizes in mathematics</a>, so if you think you have it, you should collect your one million dollars!) However, in extreme enough environments, hadrons “melt” into a <a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/the-quark-soup/">quark–gluon plasma</a> (QGP), affectionately referred to as quark–gluon soup. Delicious! In the plasma, quarks are freed from their enforced trios and can travel unconfined. As you might have guessed given the topic of this bite, it is hypothesized that the <a href="https://astrobites.org/2014/08/11/peeling-apart-a-neutron-star/">extreme density</a> at the core of neutron stars <a href="https://astrobites.org/2019/03/29/a-strange-type-of-matter-may-lie-at-the-heart-of-neutron-stars/">may be enough to create QGP</a>. However, at the surface of the neutron star, called the crust, the energy densities are too low for this plasma to exist, and all of the quarks are locked up in neutrons. Hence, there must be some transition point between the hadronic phase (the neutrons) and the quark phase (QGP) within the neutron star.</p>
<h4>Phase Transitions</h4>
<p>A phase transition is when the state of matter changes, such as liquid water freezing or boiling away. The authors predict that a phase transition in the magnetar could cause FRBs. To show this, they need a neutron star’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state">equation of state</a>, which describes how its pressure is related to its density. Finding the equation of state of a neutron star is an area of active research, so the authors use a combination of many articles working on the problem to give expressions for the equation of state of the outer hadronic crust and the gooey quark soup center.</p>
<div id="attachment_10839" style="width: 270px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dd.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10839" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-10839" src="https://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dd-260x195.png" alt="neutron star equation of state" width="260" height="195" srcset="https://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dd-260x195.png 260w, https://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dd-600x450.png 600w, https://aasnova.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dd.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-10839" class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2: The model of neutron star equation of state used by the authors. H, M, and Q stand for the hadronic, mixed, and quark regimes, respectively. The red line represents the metastable hadronic state. When the neutron star undergoes the sudden phase transition at a pressure around p, the matter jumps from the red line to the normal mixed regime line, causing the star to shrink and theoretically generating an FRB. [Shen et al. 2023]</p></div>What happens where these two regions meet? Previous models assumed that these two regimes met and didn’t interact much, but the authors argue that the two phases meet and mix slightly. The authors use thermodynamic arguments to show that droplets of the quark soup could appear in the hadronic matter. This mixing allows matter to stay in the hadronic phase deeper into the star than expected, i.e., beyond the point where it would normally become QGP: this phenomenon of the hadronic matter trespassing into what should be the QGP regime is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability">metastable</a> state. Metastable is a fancy way of saying kinda-stable. It only takes a little bit of a bump for a metastable state to collapse to the more stable of the two phases it borders, and it does so quite rapidly. You may have seen videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B405Q9LHTo">people squeezing water bottles that then freeze very quickly</a> — this is an example of water coming out of a metastable state.</p>
<p>The authors hypothesize that some of the hadronic matter will start in the metastable state, but as the neutron star’s spin slows down over the course of its life, the pressure will increase in the core and cause the hadronic matter to fully convert to quark matter (see Figure 2). This change to the denser phase would cause the star to suddenly shrink in size, and the lost gravitational potential energy would be released as an FRB. Could this be enough energy to power the FRBs we observe?</p>
<h4>Modeling the Collapse</h4>
<p>To find out, the authors solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_equation">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff</a> equation — yes, that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/manhattan-project-robert-oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</a> with the new movie coming out, though unfortunately trailers imply it’s not about his contributions to astrophysics — which describes a rotating sphere of material in gravitational equilibrium in general relativity, an excellent model of a neutron star. The authors use the equation to calculate the energy released by the neutron star as it shrinks under the phase shift for a variety of possible equations of state and models of the mixing region. They find that for an appropriate choice of the equation of state, the energy released by the phase transition would be enough to power SGR 1935+2154, and the energy release would occur roughly often enough to explain observations of repeated bursts! The authors also note that the star would only shrink by about a micrometer, and yet the system is so extremely dense that this is enough to release the energy required.</p>
<p>In addition, this rapid shift in radius would cause a starquake called a <a href="https://astrobites.org/2018/10/24/when-is-the-next-glitch-on-pulsar-j0537-6910/">glitch</a>, where the magnetar suddenly increases its spin thanks to conservation of angular momentum. Their model predicts a glitch size that is comparable to glitches observed in SGR 1935+2154. In addition, neutron stars have been observed to undergo seemingly random decreases in their spin, called <a href="https://astrobites.org/2013/06/05/an-astronomical-anti-glitch/">anti-glitches</a>. Since the exact timing of the transition in this model is dependent on the spin of the neutron star, this could explain the variability in the period of FRBs.</p>
<p>While these results are exciting, there are many hurdles to overcome. For instance, the authors note that while the energy scales match, they do not yet have a proposed mechanism for how this energy actually becomes radiation in the form of a radio pulse, <a href="https://astrobites.org/2019/03/05/shocking-model-frbs/">while other models</a> do. Nevertheless, the authors highlight that future gravitational wave observations of an FRB would be an excellent way of testing their model, as their use of a general relativistic model of an FRB would allow them to directly predict the type of gravitational wave we see. Thus, while the mystery may be unresolved, the hunt to understand FRBs will push us to understand the most extreme environments in our universe and unite disparate areas of physics and astrophysics.</p>

However, telling these apart from the torrent of “normal” flashes quickly enough for useful follow up observations will pose a daunting challenge. Thankfully, new algorithms powered by machine learning techniques may be able to triage for us.</p>
<h4>Transient Triage</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it may appear tranquil and unchanging to the casual observer, if one looks carefully, they find that the night sky is actually crackling with small, slow flashes. Thanks to modern cameras and computers, astronomers have grown increasingly attentive and now catch more of these flashes than ever before. The community flags about 20,000 so-called “transients” each year, and the rate is only expected to grow in the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large number of astronomical events, such as thermonuclear and core collapse supernovae, produce roughly similar-looking flashes, so simply spotting one does not reveal much useful information. To better study the underlying physics powering each transient, astronomers must revisit each with different types of detectors. Unfortunately, the staggering pace of discovery is too fast to thoroughly follow up on every transient. Faced with finite telescope time, astronomers need to play a constant game of triage: which transients could uncover something interesting with additional follow up, and which are just more run-of-the-mill supernovae that we can allow to fade unwatched without worry of missing something exciting? An increasingly promising way to decide is to cede the choice to a machine learning algorithm.</span></p>
<h4>FLEET and the Forest</h4>

Here, both random forests were asked to consider archived observations of many previous transients. FLEET 2.0 generally outperformed its predecessor and uncovered tens of transients that may have actually been superluminous supernovae but went undiagnosed before fading. [Gomez et al. 2023a]</p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pair of recent articles in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Astrophysical Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Sebastian Gomez (Space Telescope Science Institute) details the performance and recent upgrades of one such algorithm. Named “Finding Luminous and Exotic Extragalactic Transients,” or FLEET, this random-forest classifier takes in the first few days of observations of a transient and metadata about its host galaxy, then outputs the probability that the transient is a certain type of astronomical event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gomez and collaborators were particularly interested in two types of rare explosions: superluminous supernovae and tidal disruption events. The community has only ever observed a handful of each, though more are likely hiding in the constant stream of transient discoveries. By training FLEET to latch onto subtle differences between transients and quickly extract the underlying event, the team could prioritize follow-up resources to target promising candidates and expand their so-far sparse catalogs.</span></p>

Note that currently astronomers have observed fewer than 100 tidal disruption events. [Gomez et al. 2023a]</p></div><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its original release in 2020, FLEET is responsible for flagging 41% of all recorded superluminous supernovae. Even more exciting than its previously impressive performance, however, is its future potential. The team made sure that their algorithm could plug into data streams of future surveys, like the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, the former of which is expected to observe, but not immediately recognize, up to 10,000 tidal disruption events alone each year. Using FLEET, the community could extract up to 2,000 of these events each year for further study. Considering that our current understanding of these chaotic processes is built on fewer than 100 observations, this would revolutionize the field in ways we can’t yet predict. </span></p>
