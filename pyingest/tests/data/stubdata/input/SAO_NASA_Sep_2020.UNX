Improving treatment methods and modalities can lead to significant impacts on the life quality of cancer patients. One such method is stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a form of External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT). It delivers a highly conformal dose of radiation to a target from beams arranged at many different angles. The goal of any radiotherapy treatment is to deliver radiation only to the cancerous cells while maximally sparing other tissues. However, such a perfect treatment outcome is difficult to achieve due to the physical limitations of EBRT. The quality of treatment is dependent on the characteristics of these beams and the number of angles of which radiation is delivered. However, as technology and techniques have improved, the dependence on the quality of beams and beam coverage may have become less critical.This thesis investigates different geometric aspects of stereotactic radiotherapy and their impacts on treatment quality. The specific aims are: (1) To explore the treatment outcome of a virtual stereotactic delivery where no geometric limit exists in the sense of physical collisions. This allows for the full solid angle treatment space to be investigated and to explore if a large solid angle space is necessary to improve treatment. (2) To evaluate the effect of a reduced solid angle with a specific radiotherapy device using real clinical cases. (3) To investigate how the quality of a single beam influences treatment outcome when multiple overlapping beams are in use. (4) To study the feasibility of using a novel treatment method of lattice radiotherapy with an existing stereotactic device for treating breast cancer. All these aims were investigated with the use of inverse planning optimization and Monte-Carlo based particle transport simulations.For aim (1), multiple simulations of radiotherapy treatments were created by positioning beams on the surface of a sphere to cover a solid angle up to 4Ï€ steradians. Plans were optimized, and dosimetric criteria compared between the plans. Additionally, for aim (1), multi-leaf collimation was used to shape beams to a target volume. Results showed minimal improvements when increasing the solid angle space. The clinical benefit of a reduced solid angle treatment space is presented in (2). Here, using a device-specific to treating breast cancer, it is shown how critical structures can be beneficiaries of fewer beam angles.Aim (3) was explored by optimizing plans using varying degrees of beam quality. Beam quality was adjusted by changing beam geometric penumbra. Results show that in the case of stereotactic radiotherapy, the overlapping of multiple isocenter focal spots of radiation can create a conformal distribution.In aim (4), comparisons between simulation and experiment were conducted to explore the use of lattice radiotherapy in the breast. This final investigation resulted in a positive outlook for lattice radiotherapy, showcasing its feasibility to treat and manage large breast tumors.Through investigating the geometric means of a radiotherapy apparatus, we show how limiting factors can be overcome or are not necessary for improving treatment outcomes. These aims can help direct the future development of radiotherapy techniques.  aSchool code: 0075. 4aPhysics. 4aBiomedical engineering. 4aOncology.  aRadiotherapy  aStereotactic  aTreatment quality  a0605  a0992  a054120aThe George Washington University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg82-03B.  a0075  aPh.D.  a2020  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28025054

In particular, visual circuits sensitive to contrast, texture, color, motion, and orientation help create internal representations of our visual world and guide animal behavior. Visual motion enhances saliency of perceived objects and is critical for coordinating animal reflexes and more complicated behaviors, such as flight-or-fight responses. This dissertation is divided in two parts. Part I focuses on visual processing in the mammalian retina, particularly visual feature selectivity across different biological length scales. As it will be described in further detail in Chapter 1, motion sensitivity is first computed in the retina by dedicated circuits that give rise to direction and axial-selective responses. Understanding the mechanisms underlying motion detection in the mammalian retina can provide a foundation for describing complex neural computations in higher order brain areas. In the mammalian retina, the detection of motion direction, or direction selectivity, is first observed in the dendrites of starburst amacrine cells (SACs). Individual dendritic sectors of SACs exhibit centrifugal preference for the direction of motion, meaning that they are maximally activated by objects moving from soma to tip and only weakly activated by motion in opposite direction, tip to soma. This remarkable dendritic computation can be achieved in such a compact neuron because dendritic sectors in SACs are eletrotonically isolated from each other; however, the mechanisms orchestrating this fine balance between integration and isolation is not completely understood. In Chapter 2, we look into the contributions of synaptic mechanisms and cell-intrinsic properties to compartmentalized signaling in SACs. Our results highlight how metabotropic glutamate receptor II (mGluR2) and voltage-gated potassium channels of subfamily 3 (Kv3) regulate dendritic excitability and the initiation of non-linear calcium events along the dendrites of SACs.The direction selective signals in the dendrites of SACs are relayed to direction-selective ganglion cells, which transform inhibitory and excitatory inputs into a direction-selective spiking output that is transmitted to downstream visual nuclei, including the superior colliculus and visual thalamus. Asymmetric GABAergic inhibition from SACs to DSGCs is considered the central mechanism for direction selectivity in DSGCs; although, SACs also release acetylcholine which activate nicotinic acethylcholine receptors DSGCs and represents a significant fraction of total excitatory charge in these neurons. In Chapter 3, we look into parallel mechanisms for retinal direction selectivity by using conditional transgenic strategies to manipulate individual synapses in the direction selective circuit. Results from this study highlight how excitatory mechanisms contribute to direction selectivity and expands on the roles of SACs in visual processing. In Chapter 4, I worked together with external collaborators to determine the extent of which retinal direction selectivity influences signaling in a major retinorecipient target, the superior colliculus. Then, I characterized transgenic methods to express GCaMP6 in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in effort to improve and streamline functional imaging in the output neurons of the retina (Chapter 5). Using the Vglut2-IRES-Cre mouse line to express GCaMP6 in RGCs, I monitored the abundance of motion sensitive receptive fields across development and characterized the response properties of On-Off orientation sensitive, or axis selective, receptive fields in Chapter 6.Part II of this dissertation focuses on next-generation devices and tools for the interrogation of neural circuits. Currently, biological systems are interrogated with bulky electrodes, which tend to be highly invasive because of their large-scale dimensions and mechanical mismatch with targeted tissue. As described in Chapter 7,  recent advances in nanoscale technologies have facilitated the development of novel materials that are well suited for biological applications, including flexible alternatives to rigid and invasive probes. In Chapter 8, I discuss the fabrication of porous silicon nanowires and their application as optical tools for neuronal stimulation. Lastly, in Chapter 9 we describe a carbon-based supercapacitor and demonstrate efficient stimulation in neural and cardiac tissues.  aSchool code: 0330. 4aNeurosciences. 4aBiophysics. 4aMaterials science.  acomputation  adendrites  adirection selectivity  aneural circuits  aneuromodulation  avision  a0317  a0786  a079420aThe University of Chicago.bBiophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg82-03B.  a0330  aPh.D.  a2020  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28026164

The proper modeling of turbulent velocity and magnetic fields, the validity of mean-field theories in astrophysical flows, and its accuracy and precision when compared to astronomical observations are the main focus of this thesis. In particular, the following studies on astrophysical dynamos and accretion disks are presented: (1) We construct a new model of galactic dynamos in which the turbulent kinetic energy and correlation time are coupled to the galactic differential rotation. We find that a strong differential rotation, while contributing to field amplification by line stretching, can ultimately reduce the overall saturated magnetic field strength compared to conventional models because it decreases the turbulent correlation time when its effect on turbulence is included. (2) We present an efficient, concise, physically grounded way of calculating turbulent transport coefficients through averaging the motion of a single fluid blob. The demonstrated configuration-space calculation gives the same result as much lengthier previously used Fourier-space methods. (3) We generalize dynamo quenching theory to anisotropic flows. Understanding how strong magnetic fields can become in astrophysical objects via dynamos is an active area of research, but quenching theories with predictive power so far have almost exclusively been restricted to systems in which turbulence is isotropic and homogenous. We generalize the isotropic dynamical quenching formulae to anisotropic Î±2 dynamos, where a new ``selective-damping-Ï„' closure is proposed that conserves magnetic helicity as required, reduces to previous results when the turbulence is isotropic, and includes the full Lorentz force backreaction of the magnetic field for anisotropic flows. (4) We study the consequences of finite scale separation on validity and precision of mean-field dynamo theories. The governing equations for mean field dynamos are newly derived to properly include terms in higher order of the scale ratio between mean and fluctuating fields, and the intrinsic and filtering errors as two types of precision are identified. The formalism is then applied to a galactic dynamo model and its Faraday rotation measure, in order to quantify the precision of theoretical predictions. (5) We generalize the technique and approach for mean field precision calculation that we first worked out for dynamos and apply it to a hydrodynamic accretion disk model. The fluctuations in the local black-body emission are carefully averaged to obtain a predicted 1 Ïƒ error bar in the observed spectrum. This produces a precision error of the theory that must be included when assessing agreement or disagreement between theories and observations.  aSchool code: 0188. 4aAstrophysics. 4aPhysics. 4aAstronomy.  a0596  a0605  a060620aUniversity of Rochester.bSchool of Arts and Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg82-03B.  a0188  aPh.D.  a2020  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28027119

However, conventional fluorescence microscopy is limited by optical diffraction, which blurs cellular structures at sizes smaller than the 3D diffraction limit. This thesis introduces a new way to break the diffraction limit using a laser scanning mechanism and non-linear post-processing algorithms.The proposed laser scanning super-resolution microscope has a resolution limit that depends on image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). With reasonable SNRs, simulations show that it can achieve more than three times resolution improvement in all three dimensions. Experiments verified the simulation results and demonstrated 3D super-resolution with a variety of biological samples. Besides SNRs, algorithms in post-processing also play an important factor in final resolution improvement. The optimal algorithm is shown to be the one that matches the noise models in image acquisition. Regularization further improves the resolution when the regularization term reflects the prior knowledge of the estimated object. Compared with other super-resolution methods, this laser scanning microscope does not require complex optics, special fluorophores, or manipulating the fluorescing states to surpass the diffraction-limited resolution. With the simplicity in the optical design and the compatibility to a broad range of fluorophores, this method provides a practical approach for imaging biological fine structures with 3D super-resolution.  aSchool code: 0051. 4aOptics. 4aEngineering.  a3D imaging  aComputational imaging  aDeconvolution  aLaser scanning microscopy  aPSF engineering  aSuper-resolution microscopy  a0752  a053720aUniversity of Colorado at Boulder.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg82-03B.  a0051  aPh.D.  a2020  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28031126

Described in this dissertation are the use of Fe(III)-carboxylate photochemistry for sustainable material applications such as surface modifications and controlled plant nutrient delivery. Quantitative photochemistry of the Fe(III)-alginate system in aqueous solutions was studied using near UV light, and the effect of factors such as alginate composition and solution pH was studied. Degradation of alginate chain with the photochemical reaction was observed by the changes in the solution viscosity. The photochemical reaction seemed to proceed through a radical species and the generation of carbon dioxide anion radical (CO2.âˆ’) was identified using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We present all polysaccharide hydrogels prepared with agarose and carboxylate group containing pectin which showed photoresponsive behavior. Upon Fe(III) coordination and irradiation with 405 nm LED for various time intervals, these gels changed their pH, mechanical properties, porous structure and swelling properties. Based on the radical generation phenomenon, studies on polymerization of selected acrylic monomers using this Fe(III)-carboxylate photochemical system was studied. Other than polyuronate based hydrogels, fabrics with introduced carboxylate functionality showed their ability to polymerize acrylic monomers on their surface, and change their physical and mechanical properties with the use of light. Hydrogel beads prepared with alginate or alginate and other polysaccharide mixtures with Fe(III) showed their ability to absorb phosphate ions from model waste solutions. The solution phosphate concentration dependent phosphate uptake showed a maximum phosphate uptake around 1.5 mggâˆ’1. Phosphate uptake above 1 mggâˆ’1 was seen for a wide pH range of 4.8â€“11.5 due to the strong binding between Fe(III) within the hydrogels and phosphates. Occurrence of the Fe(III)-carboxylate photochemistry in these hydrogel beads upon exposure to light degraded the hydrogels and released the trapped phosphates into the environment. The release was dependent on the light intensity and the release under dark conditions was negligible. Plant trials conducted in a greenhouse showed these gel beads degrade within couple of weeks and release the nutrients to soil environment slowly compared to conventional chemical fertilizer. Therefore Fe(III)-carboxylate photochemistry can be used for greener material applications as well as wastewater treatment.  aSchool code: 0018. 4aMaterials science. 4aChemical engineering.  aPhotochemistry  aIron(III)  aCarboxylate  aPolysaccharides  aSustainable materials  a0794  a054220aBowling Green State University.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg82-03B.  a0018  aPh.D.  a2020  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:28144636
