# adsabs-pyingest

A collection or python parsers, validators, and serializers for adsabs 
ingest pipeline.  For the time being all we have is simple stuff used to
ingest data into ADS Classic, but this is meant to grow and change in 
due time as our metadata models become more sophisticated.

We are now starting to implement parsers that can be used to ingest directly
into Solr (e.g. dubcore/arxiv).  See the repository ADS_Direct_Import for
an example of this application.
