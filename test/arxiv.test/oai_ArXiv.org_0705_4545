 <dc:description>  The Nielsen Realization problem asks when the group homomorphism from Diff(M)
to pi_0 Diff(M) admits a section. For M a closed surface, Kerckhoff proved that
a section exists over any finite subgroup, but Morita proved that if the genus
is large enough then no section exists over the entire mapping class group. We
prove the first nonexistence theorem of this type in dimension 4: if M is a
smooth closed oriented 4-manifold which contains a K3 surface as a connected
summand then no section exists over the whole of the mapping class group. This
is done by showing that certain obstructions lying in the rational cohomology
of B(pi_0 Diff(M)) are nonzero. We detect these classes by showing that they
are nonzero when pulled back to the moduli space of Einstein metrics on a K3
surface.

 <dc:description>Comment: 20 pages, published version. ERRATUM: This paper is withdrawn. As
  pointed out by Bena Tshishiku, Borel's theorem on the cohomology stable range
  for arithmetic groups is incorrectly quoted and applied in this paper; in the
  case relevant to K3 surfaces the range is unfortunately zero. Hence the proof
  of the part of Theorem 1.1 referring to K3 surfaces is fundamentally broken.
