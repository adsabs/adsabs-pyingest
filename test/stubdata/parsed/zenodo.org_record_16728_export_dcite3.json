    "abstract": "This thesis consists of inteferometric observations of carbon monoxide<br />\n    from three planetary atmospheres. The observations address specific<br />\n    questions about the state and structure of each atmosphere. The<br />\n    analysis and results for each planetary body are contained within<br />\n    individual chapters of the thesis, and the abstract for each is<br />\n    reproduced below.</p>Titan: Evidence for a Well-Mixed Vertical Profile</p>We report on new millimeter heterodyne observations of the <sup>12</sup>CO J(1&minus;0)<br />\n    rotational transition from the stratosphere of Titan made in October<br />\n    1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. The<br />\n    spectrum obtained clearly exhibits a strong emission core over the<br />\n    &sim;600 MHz bandwidth of the upper sideband spectrometer. The lineshape,<br />\n    referenced to the flat spectrum simultaneously observed in the lower<br />\n    sideband, was inverted to determine a best fit CO mixing ratio profile<br />\n    consistent with the observations. The best fit profile is a constant<br />\n    mixing ratio of 5 &plusmn; 1 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> over the altitude range of 60&ndash;200<br />\n    km. Combined with IR observations of tropospheric CO (fCO = 6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup>,<br />\n    Lutz et al. 1983) this provides strong evidence that CO is well mixed<br />\n    from the surface to at least 200 km in Titan&rsquo;s atmosphere.</p>Mars: Thermal Structure from 0&ndash;70 km</p>Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the <sup>12</sup>CO J(1&minus;0) rotational<br />\n    transition from the atmosphere of Mars were made on three dates in<br />\n    February 1993 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter<br />\n    Array. These observations yielded high-quality spectra with a spatial<br />\n    resolution of 4.2&quot; on a 12.5&quot; diameter Mars. The spectra were<br />\n    numerically inverted for profiles of the local atmospheric temperature<br />\n    from 0 to 70 km, assuming a constant CO mixing ratio for the<br />\n    atmosphere. The derived average low latitude atmospheric temperature<br />\n    profile is approximately 20 K cooler than reference temperature<br />\n    profiles compiled during the Viking era. This new temperature profile<br />\n    is well-matched by cooler profiles determined from whole disk CO<br />\n    measurements, suggesting very little dust loading of the atmosphere at<br />\n    the time of the observations (Clancy et al. 1990). In addition, the<br />\n    revealed thermal structure shows variation with latitude, and these<br />\n    temperature profiles compare well with profiles derived from Mariner 9<br />\n    IRIS observations (Leovy 1982, Santee and Crisp 1993) and calculated<br />\n    thermal structure from the Mars General Circulation Model (Haberle et<br />\n    al. 1993). The temperature profiles were averaged in local time and<br />\n    the resulting cross-section of temperature as a function of pressure<br />\n    and latitude used to infer the mean zonal circulation of the<br />\n    atmosphere. These wind results are somewhat compromised by the<br />\n    relatively low spatial resolution of the observations but do<br />\n    qualitatively match both inferred zonal winds from the Mariner 9 IRIS<br />\n    observations and Mars GCM calculations. These initial observations<br />\n    point toward the desirability of further interferometric measurements.</p>Venus: Temporal Variations of the Mesosphere</p>Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the <sup>12</sup>CO J(1&minus;0) rotational<br />\n    transition from the mesosphere of Venus were made in early November<br />\n    and early December 1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory<br />\n    Millimeter Array. The spatial resolution for each day was about 1000<br />\n    km at the sub-earth point. The high quality CO spectra were<br />\n    numerically inverted for profiles of the local CO mixing ratio from 80<br />\n    to 105 km, assuming a Pioneer Venus mean temperature profile for the<br />\n    atmosphere.&nbsp; For each day the revealed CO distribution shows a<br />\n    nightside maximum centered at low latitudes and shifted from the<br />\n    anti-solar point toward the morning terminator.&nbsp; Both days show a<br />\n    clear latitudinal falloff in the CO abundance. In November the maximum<br />\n    was centered at roughly 2h local time at 100 km, while in December the<br />\n    maximum was at roughly 4 &minus; 4.5h local time at 100 km. In addition, CO<br />\n    abundances were slightly higher in November. The changes in the CO<br />\n    distribution are examined in the context of the mesospheric<br />\n    circulation model of Clancy and Muhleman (1985b). The increased shift<br />\n    away from the anti-solar point and decreased CO abundance for the<br />\n    December observations both point toward increased zonal and/or<br />\n    decreased sub-solar to anti-solar circulation within the mesosphere<br />\n    during the month between observations.</p>&nbsp;",
