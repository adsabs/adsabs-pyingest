%B We describe the basic assumptions and key results of loop quantum gravity,
which is a background independent approach to quantum gravity. The emphasis is
on the basic physical principles and how one deduces predictions from them, at
a level suitable for physicsts in other areas such as string theory, cosmology,
particle physics, astrophysics and condensed matter physics. No details are
given, but references are provided to guide the interested reader to the
literature. The present state of knowledge is summarized in a list of 35 key
results on topics including the hamiltonian and path integral quantizations,
coupling to matter, extensions to supergravity and higher dimensional theories,
as well as applications to black holes, cosmology and Plank scale
phenomenology. We describe the near term prospects for observational tests of
quantum theories of gravity and the expectations that loop quantum gravity may
provide predictions for their outcomes. Finally, we provide answers to
frequently asked questions and a list of key open problems.
