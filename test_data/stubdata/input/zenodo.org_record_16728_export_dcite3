        <description descriptionType="Abstract">&lt;p&gt;This thesis consists of inteferometric observations of carbon monoxide&lt;br /&gt;
    from three planetary atmospheres. The observations address specific&lt;br /&gt;
    questions about the state and structure of each atmosphere. The&lt;br /&gt;
    analysis and results for each planetary body are contained within&lt;br /&gt;
    individual chapters of the thesis, and the abstract for each is&lt;br /&gt;
    reproduced below.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Titan: Evidence for a Well-Mixed Vertical Profile&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;We report on new millimeter heterodyne observations of the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO J(1&amp;minus;0)&lt;br /&gt;
    rotational transition from the stratosphere of Titan made in October&lt;br /&gt;
    1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. The&lt;br /&gt;
    spectrum obtained clearly exhibits a strong emission core over the&lt;br /&gt;
    &amp;sim;600 MHz bandwidth of the upper sideband spectrometer. The lineshape,&lt;br /&gt;
    referenced to the flat spectrum simultaneously observed in the lower&lt;br /&gt;
    sideband, was inverted to determine a best fit CO mixing ratio profile&lt;br /&gt;
    consistent with the observations. The best fit profile is a constant&lt;br /&gt;
    mixing ratio of 5 &amp;plusmn; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; over the altitude range of 60&amp;ndash;200&lt;br /&gt;
    km. Combined with IR observations of tropospheric CO (fCO = 6 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
    Lutz et al. 1983) this provides strong evidence that CO is well mixed&lt;br /&gt;
    from the surface to at least 200 km in Titan&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Mars: Thermal Structure from 0&amp;ndash;70 km&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO J(1&amp;minus;0) rotational&lt;br /&gt;
    transition from the atmosphere of Mars were made on three dates in&lt;br /&gt;
    February 1993 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter&lt;br /&gt;
    Array. These observations yielded high-quality spectra with a spatial&lt;br /&gt;
    resolution of 4.2&amp;quot; on a 12.5&amp;quot; diameter Mars. The spectra were&lt;br /&gt;
    numerically inverted for profiles of the local atmospheric temperature&lt;br /&gt;
    from 0 to 70 km, assuming a constant CO mixing ratio for the&lt;br /&gt;
    atmosphere. The derived average low latitude atmospheric temperature&lt;br /&gt;
    profile is approximately 20 K cooler than reference temperature&lt;br /&gt;
    profiles compiled during the Viking era. This new temperature profile&lt;br /&gt;
    is well-matched by cooler profiles determined from whole disk CO&lt;br /&gt;
    measurements, suggesting very little dust loading of the atmosphere at&lt;br /&gt;
    the time of the observations (Clancy et al. 1990). In addition, the&lt;br /&gt;
    revealed thermal structure shows variation with latitude, and these&lt;br /&gt;
    temperature profiles compare well with profiles derived from Mariner 9&lt;br /&gt;
    IRIS observations (Leovy 1982, Santee and Crisp 1993) and calculated&lt;br /&gt;
    thermal structure from the Mars General Circulation Model (Haberle et&lt;br /&gt;
    al. 1993). The temperature profiles were averaged in local time and&lt;br /&gt;
    the resulting cross-section of temperature as a function of pressure&lt;br /&gt;
    and latitude used to infer the mean zonal circulation of the&lt;br /&gt;
    atmosphere. These wind results are somewhat compromised by the&lt;br /&gt;
    relatively low spatial resolution of the observations but do&lt;br /&gt;
    qualitatively match both inferred zonal winds from the Mariner 9 IRIS&lt;br /&gt;
    observations and Mars GCM calculations. These initial observations&lt;br /&gt;
    point toward the desirability of further interferometric measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Venus: Temporal Variations of the Mesosphere&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Millimeter-wave heterodyne observations of the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;CO J(1&amp;minus;0) rotational&lt;br /&gt;
    transition from the mesosphere of Venus were made in early November&lt;br /&gt;
    and early December 1994 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory&lt;br /&gt;
    Millimeter Array. The spatial resolution for each day was about 1000&lt;br /&gt;
    km at the sub-earth point. The high quality CO spectra were&lt;br /&gt;
    numerically inverted for profiles of the local CO mixing ratio from 80&lt;br /&gt;
    to 105 km, assuming a Pioneer Venus mean temperature profile for the&lt;br /&gt;
    atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; For each day the revealed CO distribution shows a&lt;br /&gt;
    nightside maximum centered at low latitudes and shifted from the&lt;br /&gt;
    anti-solar point toward the morning terminator.&amp;nbsp; Both days show a&lt;br /&gt;
    clear latitudinal falloff in the CO abundance. In November the maximum&lt;br /&gt;
    was centered at roughly 2h local time at 100 km, while in December the&lt;br /&gt;
    maximum was at roughly 4 &amp;minus; 4.5h local time at 100 km. In addition, CO&lt;br /&gt;
    abundances were slightly higher in November. The changes in the CO&lt;br /&gt;
    distribution are examined in the context of the mesospheric&lt;br /&gt;
    circulation model of Clancy and Muhleman (1985b). The increased shift&lt;br /&gt;
    away from the anti-solar point and decreased CO abundance for the&lt;br /&gt;
    December observations both point toward increased zonal and/or&lt;br /&gt;
    decreased sub-solar to anti-solar circulation within the mesosphere&lt;br /&gt;
    during the month between observations.&lt;/p&gt;
